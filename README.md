### Basic syntax:
```python 

matrix_name = Matrix(dim=dimension,#Required(UNLESS listed is given), int | list as [rows,cols]

                       listed=elements, #Optional, list of numbers | list of lists containing numbers | string. If no argument is passed matrix is filled depending on the 'fill' and 'ranged' 

                       directory=directory, #Optional, string. Path to the dataset. listed parameter shouldn't get any value if directory is given

                       fill=distribution | number, #Optional,  'uniform'|'triangular'|'gauss' or integer | float | complex or None; fills the matrix with chosen distribution or number, None will force 'uniform' distribution. Doesn't affect the matrix if "listed" or "directory" is given

                       ranged=[*args] | dict;
                              ->To apply all the elements give a list | tuple
                              ->To apply every column individually give a dictionary as {"Column_name":[*args], ...}
                              ->Arguments should follow one of the following rules:
                                   1)If 'fill' is 'uniform', interval to pick numbers from as [minimum,maximum]; 
                                   2)If 'fill' is 'gauss', mean and standard deviation are picked from this attribute as [mean,standard_deviation];
                                   3)If 'fill' is 'triangular, range of the numbers and the mode as [minimum,maximum,mode]                       

                       header=hasHeader, #Optional, boolean. Default is 0. Wheter or not the dataset in the "directory" has a header row

                       features=columnNames #Optional, list of strings. If no argument given, columns get named "Col {}".format(colNumber) 
                     
                       seed=randomSeed #Optional, int|float|complex|str . Seed to generate the random numbers from, doesn't affect anything if numbers are provided.
                       
                       dtype=dataType #Optional, 'integer'|'float'|'complex' . Data type the matrix will hold, default is 'float'.
                       )

```

                     seed=4472142,
                    )

```
----------------------------------------
##### Give a string filled with data and use the numbers in it to create a matrix

#Create a matrix from the given string, dimension is *required* as [dataAmount,features]

D = Matrix(dim=[10,4],
           listed=data,
           features=["id","age","num1","num2"],
           dtype="integer"
          ) 

```
##### OR

##### Read data from files (Only tested on CSV and TXT files)
###### header: boolean value, **True** if data file has a header as the **first** row, default is **False**

###### If bool(header) is True, feature names automatically get picked up from the first row
```python 
data_directory = "Example\Directory\DATAFILE"

data_dim = [data_amount,feature_amount]

data_matrix = Matrix(dim=data_dim,directory=data_directory,header=1,dtype="float") #Create a float matrix from a table of data

```python 
E.add(r=3,lis=[1.0 ,2.5 ,52,242 ,-9883,212, 0.000001, -555,554]) #Make the list given the 3rd row

#Filter out and print the correlation matrix depending on the desired conditions
corrMat = (abs(data.corr())>0.5) & (data.corr()!=1)

#Get a matrix filled with the data matrix's first column, where elements' values are higher than 5000, put 0 otherwise (Will be updated soon)

   #roundForm() call is currently required for the next examples due to ~%1e-5 error rate on some calculations 
   
   (A.lowtri @ A.uptri).roundForm(4) == A.roundForm(4) 
   
   (A.inv.inv).roundForm(4) == A.roundForm(4)
